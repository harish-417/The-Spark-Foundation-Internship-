Data Science and Business Analytics Internship Tasks



This repository consist of the tasks given during my internship at The Sparks Foundation.

TASKS
Task 1 - Exploring Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?
